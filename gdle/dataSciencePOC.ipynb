Crews searching the Kings River in central California found the body of an 8-year-old girl quickly and her 4-year-old brother's body on Monday, per KFSN. The Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said the children, along with their mother and her friend, stepped into the water about a mile from Pine Flat Dam, NBC News reports. \"The group was trying make their way out to a specific rock to climb on when the current carried the kids away,\" the sheriff's office said. The children were not wearing life jackets, the statement said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rescue effort enlisted 40 search and rescue personnel, boats, a remote-controlled vehicle in the water, drones and a sheriff's helicopter, per KFSN. The girl's body was found near the dam and the boy's two miles downriver. Recreational users have been prohibited from using the river since mid-March, when heavy storms and melting snow led to dangerous water levels. Signs saying so have been placed along the river. Violations can bring fines, and officials said parents letting their children go into the water could be charged with child neglect and child endangerment. \"The water remains cold, in the low 50s, the current is swift, and trees serve as dangerous obstacles,\" sheriff's officials said.

Her colleagues in the Cyber Police had handed her the number of a youth who had put a social media post announcing his plan to end his life. The boy, from a village in Solapur, was upset after failing an exam.“Come on yaar, you cannot think of killing yourself just because you’ve failed. I had failed too when I was young. Had I given up, I wouldn’t be a police officer today,” Shinde said to the boy, chatting informally as a friend would. The talk cheered him up: by the time the conversation ended he had promised to delete the post.Shinde is part of a team of six from the Cyber Police that has been acting on alerts shared by tech company Meta about Facebook or Instagram users posting suicidal thoughts. Meta closely monitors text, videos and images — ranging from a ceiling fan to a knife to poison or pills — that may signal a user’s intention to take the drastic step.Between January and April 2023, the Cyber Police has thus averted 31 suicide bids across India. This work of tackling alerts is done alongside their regular job of solving online crimes.At odd hours, sometimes as early as 3am, sub-inspector Dhanvish Patil from the Cyber Police can be found glued to his phone. Patil’s job is to receive inputs from Meta round-the-clock and share them on a WhatsApp group. “Meta sends us a copy of the post along with details of the user and a phone number associated with his account, if any,” says Patil. The team then gets down to work.If the user’s phone number is readily available, Shinde calls to counsel the individual in distress. If there’s no phone number or if it is switched off, team members analyse the user’s IP address to find his location. They contact the police station closest to his residence and request officers to pay him a visit.Inputs from Meta are not restricted to Facebook users from Maharashtra alone.In one instance, a Varanasi resident uploaded a video clip where he could be seen offering some kind of liquid to his children. The kids were refusing it and were pleading with their father to not consume it either. Shinde immediately got on the phone with the man, asking him what was wrong and how could she help. Police were concerned that consumption of the liquid could prove fatal for the family. The man said his wife had left him to move in with her paramour. He believed that posting a video clip of their children would make her regret her actions and return. After his conversation with Shinde, he agreed to take down the video.“It’s immensely satisfying for us to see that our interventions are helping save lives,” said DCP (Cyber) Balsingh Rajput.The Cyber Police have a unique set of challenges. If an individual in distress is located in a remote area, finding the nearest police station and getting hold of officers may take time. Moreover, individuals may react in unexpected ways if uniformed personnel land up at their house, particularly if the family is unaware of their social media post. Cases have to be handled with utmost sensitivity.In one incident in February, a farmer’s son, who had posted online about ending his life over his failed career, kept moving to different locations through the night. The Cyber Police had informed the crime branch who pursued him for nine hours before finally catching up with him at Karjat.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories   PreviousDelhi Heatwaves: 8 Easy Ways to Beat the HeatcityIndia-Australia relationship is based on mutual trust and mutual respect:PMModiindiaHottest Indian Cities Amid Heatwaveindia8 MLAs take oath as ministers in newly-inducted Karnataka cabinetindiaNoida varsity received 2-3 complaints from girl shot on campuscityLive: Siddaramaiah thanks Ktaka voters in first address after taking oath as CMindiaG7 live: Will do whatever we can for resolution of war, says PM after meeting ZelenskyyindiaI want it Mumbais way: Backstreet Boys back in India after 13 yearscityIn MPs Bandhavgarh, signs of 2,000-year-old modern societycityPictures: Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto in India​india Next123ElectionsKarnataka Assembly SessionMadhya Pradesh ElectionsKarnataka AssemblyRajasthan Elections 2023Chhattisgarh ElectionsTelangana Election 2023Mizoram ElectionsAssembly Election 2023TOP TRENDSKerala DHSE Plus Two ResultParliament Building InaugurationDelhi Dehradun Vande BharatHPBOSE 10th Result 2023GT vs MI Qualifier 2New Parliament BuildingTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteNew Parliament opening: 20 parties say theyll boycott, 17 to attend8-9 hours of study, healthy social life: UPSC topper Ishita Kishores secret to success3rd time lucky: UPSC topper Ishita Kishore failed to clear prelims in 1st two triesHistoric Sengol to be placed in new Parl building: Amit ShahLive: Australia will establish consulate in Bluru, Albanese saysIIM Calcuttas DBL program for aspiring CXOsWhy opt for moneyviews personal loans?Femina & Mamaearth unveil Beautiful Indians 2023Women bag top 4 ranks in civil services, 3 are from DUNot acceptable: PM Modi raises issue of attacks on temples in Australia with PM AlbanesePakistan growth slows sharply as economic challenges mountKarnataka cabinet expansion: 24 ministers to take oath on May 27Why its important to simplify your investments as you ageAfter Ktaka, Amul’s expansion plan for TN runs into rough weatherNew MP chambers won’t be ready by March next yearMiG-29K fighter conducts night landing on indigenous aircraft carrierTurkiyes next president will win an economy in crisisCar crashes into front gates of Downing Street in LondonMan loses Rs 70 lakh to ‘WhatsApp WFH scam’: How the fraud started, how cybercriminals work and moreBJP, Cong trade barbs over inauguration of new ParliamentAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimes NowTimes Now NavbharatTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRupali GangulyBeer BenefitsWeight Loss DrinkSudha MurtyHarisriDVV Danayya SonAmala PaulMouni RoyIleana DcruzRelationships TipsTop TrendsKerala DHSE Plus Two ResultParliament Building InaugurationDelhi Dehradun Vande BharatHPBOSE 10th Result 2023GT vs MI Qualifier 2New Parliament BuildingAmul vs AavinManipur ViolenceRBSE 12th Arts Result 2023Akash MadhwalGSEB SSC Result 2023Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin PilotMP Board 12th ResultIPL 2023WB Madhyamik ResultWBBME Result 2023IPL Schedule 2023World Test Championship FinalTrending TopicsHair CareTipsNawazuddin SiddiquiVarshini SounderajanKeerthy SureshMango BenefitsHealthy FoodRelationships TipsPopular FoodShraddha KapoorKannada ActressesKayadu LoharTollywood ActressesParenting TipsJanhvi KapoorNitesh PandeySarath Babu Death NewsVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentViral NewsViral VideosFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.
